# Surface-Energy-Modelling
Here is a MATLAB code for calculating the surface energy by three different models namely Zisman model which is a one component model, Owen/Wendt (or Fowkes, both models are mathematically similar but has different theoritcal bases) which is a two component model and lastly Van oss-Good model which is a three component model. I am also attaching the excel file from which I have taken the data input and also attaching a reference pdf by Kruss scientific. Hope it helps!! Good luck :)
